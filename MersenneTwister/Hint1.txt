1. Initialization:
    Create a length n array (MT) to store the state of the generator.
    Set the index to n.
    Define constants for the lower mask and upper mask.
    Seed the generator with a given value.

2. Seed:
    Set the index to n.
    Initialize the first element of MT to the seed value.
    For each subsequent element of MT, set it to the result of applying a mathematical function to the previous element of MT.

3. Generate number:
    If the index is greater than or equal to n, call the twist function to update the state of the generator.
    Extract the next number from the MT array using the current index.
    Modify the extracted number using a series of bitwise operations.
    Increment the index.
    Return the modified number.

4. Twist:
    For each element of MT, compute a new value based on a combination of the current element and the next element in the array.
    Apply additional bitwise operations to the computed value.
    Update the corresponding element of MT with the computed value.
    Reset the index to 0.

5. Repeat:
    Repeat steps 3 and 4 as many times as desired to generate a sequence of random numbers.
